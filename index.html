										<h2>Oleksii Dubovyk</h2>
										<p>I am a Fulbright Graduate Student from Ukraine<br />
										studying avian communities assembly<br />
										in Walters Lab at Old Dominion University</p>
									</header>
									<p>I started my scientific path as an undergraduate student at Ivan Franko National University of Lviv 
										(Ukraine) in 2015. I dedicated my independent research project to environmental factors that may 
										predict community structure in birds of parks and forests in and outside of the urban matrix. 
										I successfully graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 2019 and started a Master's program, also
										having a part-time job of a field scientist in the "Roztochia" Nature Reserve. My life, though,
										rapidly changed when I was announced to be a Fulbright Graduate Student Program finalist in 2020, and 
										I moved to Norfolk, VA, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic to start my Master's program with 
										<a href="https://ericlwalters.org/">Dr. Eric L. Walters</a>. </p>
									<p>My scientific interests lay within an intersection of community ecology, data analysis, 
										and conservation biology. That means that I mostly spend my time (i) being adored by famous 
										and/or fresh papers in theoretical community ecology, i.e., species-abundance distributions and 
										species-area relationship, neutral theory vs. niche theory, diversity and similarity measures, 
										combining it with (ii) hours of coding in R and spatial analysis in QGIS, ArcGIS, and Google Earth 
										Engine, and (iii) thinking about using all those skills for a better protection of birds. </p>	
									<p>The project I am currently working on is dedicated to the use of functional diversity framework to 
										track temporal changes in spatial distribution of functional rarity within avian communities 
										across North America. I test the hypotheses on what the possible drivers of those changes are, 
										for example, land-use changes associated with urbanization, climate change, conservation efforts. 
										This will help to understand what is needed in order to protect the functional diversity of birds - in 
										other words, how to preserve ecosystem functioning in the face of extinction events.</p>
									<p>I am currently a Ph.D. (in Ecological Sciences) student at Old Dominion University and a 
										graduate teaching assistant at Department of Biological Sciences.

											<h4>Functional Rarity in North American Birds</h4>
											<p>My MS project has a working title "Spatial Distribution of Functionally Rare Landbird Species in North America". 
												In this project, I analyze data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and eBird covering Canada, the United States, 
												and Mexico from 2000 to 2021, combined with data on 23 functional traits, to calculate regional rarity and functional distinctiveness 
												of 680 breeding bird species. This will allow conservation biologists to identify locations where the ongoing extinction crisis threats 
												the functional diversity of birds the most.

											<h4>Avifauna of the Ukraine-Poland Border</h4>
											<p>I participated in the project aimed to locate the remnants of the population of the Great Snipe (<i>Gallinago media</i>). 
											The project took place in meadows adjacent to the Ukrainian-Polish border which is being rarely visited by field biologists. 
											During the weeks of fieldwork, long with looking for the Great Snipes, we were documenting the avian diversity of these areas 
											which was before unknown.</p>

											<h4>Lviv Point Counts Monitoring Scheme</h4>
											<p>Together with Hanna Kuzyo, we have been trying to commence a citizen-science program in Lviv city that would start a long-term 
												collection of data on changes in populations of urban birds. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and full-scale Russian military aggression, 
												dozens of volunteers were able to collect thousands of observations from almost 500 square kilometers since 2019, and the project is 
												still ongoing. We also are trying to scale this program up in order to establish regional monitoring of birds compliant with the 
												<a href="https://pecbms.info/">Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme</a>. </p>

											<h4>Migration of Birds through Borzhava Mountain Ridge</h4>
											<p>In 2019, the conservation community of Ukraine has received the alarming news that there are plans to build a massive wind farm 
												on top of Borzhava mountain ridge, which is one of the highest regions in the Ukrainian Carpathian mountains. Yet, there were no 
												nature protected areas that would make the project impossible, and conservationists had little data from the region. I was a part of the team 
												that made several expeditions to the mountains and later was responsible for analysis of the data collected. The data have shown that 
												Borzhava serves as an important corridor for bird migration, and wind turbines would result in numerous collisions, potentially 
												killing the birds.

											<h4>Community Structure in Birds of Urban Parks and Forests</h4>
											<p>After my first year of data collection in urban parks I expanded the project to cover the forests adjacent to the city. It yielded a 
												large dataset that allowed me to test various hypotheses about community assembly, as well as conservation-oriented questions. For example, 
												I have shown that although protected areas around the cities host many unique species of birds that avoid urbanized areas, the abundance of 
												species of conservation concern is actually higher in urban parks. This, eventually, made me to question the definition of rarity of taxa and 
												directed my interests into the concept of functional rarity, which is more ecologically meaningful.

											<h4>Winter Birds Assemblages in Parks and Cemeteries</h4>
											<p>My first scientific independent project considered cemeteries and parks of Lviv. Trying to find a way to test whether avian communities 
												inhabiting cemeteries are considerably different from the ones in urban parks has led me to the topic of similarity indices and, 
												ultimately, to the very beginnings of statistical inference and data analysis.
